## RMCDA, a universal R package for multi-criteria decision making

RMDA provides a variety of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDM) method. Below we review some of these methods and explain how you can utilize this R package for your specific data. 

###Load the R package

```{r}
library(RMCDA)
```

###Let's see how the input data looks like

```{r}
data <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "AHP_input_file.csv", package = "RMCDA"), header=FALSE)
mat.lst <- read.csv.AHP.matrices(data)
mat.lst
```

It should be a list containing four matrices, the first matrix includes pairwise comparisons between criteria and the next three matrices are pairwise comparisons of alternatives for each criteria. 

###Let's apply AHP

```{r}
mat.lst[[1]]->A
mat.lst[[2]]->comparing.competitors
results<- apply.AHP(A, comparing.competitors)
print(results)
```
