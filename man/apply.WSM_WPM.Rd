\title{Apply Weighted Sum Model (WSM) or Weighted Product Model (WPM) on data}
\usage{
apply.WSM_WPM(mat, beneficial.vector, weights, method = "WSM")
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{is a matrix and contains the values for different properties
of different alternatives}

\item{beneficial.vector}{is a vector that contains the column number of beneficial
properties.}

\item{weights}{are the weights of each property in the decision making process}
}
\value{
a vector containing the calculated preference score, run rank(-apply.WSM(mat, beneficial.vector, weights))
to get the ranks
}
